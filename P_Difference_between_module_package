Difference between Python Module and Package


A module is basically a bunch of related code saved in a file with the extension .py. You may choose to define functions, classes, or variables in a module. Itâ€™s also fine to include runnable code in modules.



def welcome_note(course):
  print("Hi Good Mornining Stundets of " + course + " You will understand the difference between Module and Package")
  
  
  
  To have this function stored in the module welcome, save this code in a file named welcome.py
  
  
  To use this code in an application, 
  
  first import the respective module using the import statement. 
  
  Then, ready to use a function defined in this module by calling that function with the module.function() 
  
  Example:
  
import welcome
welcome.welcome_note("Python")


Output
Hi Good Mornining Stundets of Python You will understand the difference between Module and Package

#Another way of importing

from welcome import welcome_note
